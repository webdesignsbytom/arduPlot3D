Binary format for vector commands

## Components

TPGL Header - tool type - set up info
TPGL Body - main simulation
TPGL Footer - whats in this?

## Commands

### Motions

1. Move to = M
2. Finger Down = FD
3. Finger Up = FU
4. Terminate = T (‚êÉ) 0x03
5. XY speed = IS
6. Change XY speed = IX
7. Z speed = OS
8. Change Z speed = OX
9. Number of fingers FN
10. Pause = P

### Data Types

Plot points have 5 data tpyes

1. Tap = DT
2. Move and Tap = DMT
3. Drag = DD
4. Move = DM
5. Time out DTO

### Functions

Test functions and UI commands
Sequence alphabetical after T

1. Test XY = TA
2. Text Z = TB
3. Text XYZ = TC
4. Test finger 1 = TD 
5. Test finger 2 = TE 
6. Test finger 3 = TF
7. Zero/Home All axis = Z - not a test function
